# Ethernet-Temperature-Controller_Arduino
 Brewary fridge controller
 
## What do we need?
- [x] Arduino Mega 2560 (or uno)
- [x] Appropriate Ethernet Shield
- [x] Temperature Sensor DS18B20
- [x] LED 5mm
- [x] Resistor 4,7K (to temp sensor)
- [x] Appropiate Resistor to your LED

## Explenation of files
- [ ] DalladTemperature - Arduino library which is needed!
- [ ] Ethernet_Temperature_Controller_Arduino.ino - We have to upload this file to arduino via Arduino IDE
- [ ] ethernetcss.css - Don't mind about this file, u can use it instead of server one.
- [ ] Schematic.png - Connect everyting like on this schem.

## Functions
- Setting temperature via website
- When temperature to high, turns on the fridge
